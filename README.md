# Update from initial prototype

Script-3 // Removal of the API call to get the news as mentioned from the prototype comments, it's just too much fluff. Therefore, took a step back and simplified the project so hopefully it doesn't lose too much of its meaning and worked on the details of the initial prototype. voila.

# The Map of the words
The Map is not the territory - the response is not the answer. 


The user input their questions, the machine spit out random answer from the essay of alfred korzybski The map is the territory Bernhard Siegert & Jorge Borge Luis.

This is a wink to the idea that similarly to the semantic that the map is not the territory, the speech output here doesn't necessarly provide an answer even tho it will respond. 

For the words the user will input, it will create a map, like a map of the world, but representating the map the the words. 

Intention is to show that the response can be non-sensitivical


// Notes: Rejection of meaning (how to go fully in that sense?)

push into the feeling of how the user would feel 
proclamation (machine sharing a feeling?)
connection from the user text, and the machine text (how can we implement the relation in-between the user/Machine) 

What can I do to convey the feeling to the user?

Test out question by the machine? 

Don't forget the Map?

1- The machine is saying something at the beginning (My response will not be an answer, but I will reply to you)

In reference to Jorge Borge Luis and Alfred Korzybski expression of The Map is not the Territory, it is showcase with the understanding as such that the perception and the reality are not being the same nonetheless of the similarities. This is a wink to the idea that similarly to the semantic of the map is not the territory, the speech and the news output is not an exact representation of the world we are living in a litteral way.

The project wishes to touch on the perception versus the reality around the world, coming from that tiny machine the audience is interacting with. Does the response provided by the program is representative of what is happening? 

The user input their questions, the machine spit out random answer from the essay of alfred korzybski The map is the territory Bernhard Siegert & Jorge Borge Luis.

The words are spit out from the machine similarly to the words from news outlet being bombarded to us as such they are bullet and stimuli of information. Mechanical news and mechanical speech voice, trying to make sense of the worlds. An intention to show that the response can be non-sensitivical as much as how sometimes news can be insensitive , and how as human we oftentime are appealed some of the bad news. 

2 - PLAN 

Based on the Prototype of “The map of the words”
- First Scene (Introduction) using HTML/CSS
- Introduction explaining these are news updates with a “fake” map
- Jingle news music using p5js sounds
- Interactivity with point on Map using JS will showcase news? (still tbd)
- Flow and input from the Users to be determine as I am learning API
- Voice Speech based on Audience input of the words
- Voice Output (still tbd)

3 - TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

Challenges will be to learn documentation and Implement the API (world’s News) within the project
- GET API KEY (e.g.) https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=Apple&from=2024-03-26&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=c3396e37e9bf493381de2ddc7c175ba3
- Create request to generate
- Get responses (JSON data) to load on the project
- Understanding the documentation for APIs
- Chrome extension to format the datas?
- Alignment of assets in CSS (my least favorite)
- Visually implement the News on screen? (still TBD)
